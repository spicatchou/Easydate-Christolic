Data visualisation with DASH / Data cleaning  + descriptive statistics and Machine learning with Python (pandas,numpy, scikitlearn)

Hi, let’s talk about machine learning, get back when we carried out the first team-project of the year spent at the French university Lyon II in order to be graduated in Data Science in 2023 (Master). 
Our mission : to find out the best model aiming at predicting “love”- let’s call it “match” - between two people. In other words, discover the magic formula to take over the “speed dating” heterosexual market. **KPI : f1 score**. 

Provided data : a survey carried out by a group of students at Columbia University.  Sample : 6804 students – around half coming from miscellaneous American universities – the other half coming from European or Asian universities. Average Age : 26 y.o. Rate of match : < 20%. 

Protocol : 8 out of 10 people met 10 partners (the other ones : 6). Everybody had to fill-in an extensive form covering demo (age, gender,…), personal fields of interest (TV, reading,…), and their expectations regarding their ideal partner. All the met partners rated them in return (e.g.: "On a scale from 0 to 10, to what extend look your partner attractive ?") Ouput : 70 variables to be cleaned (missing data, same intel reported several times in different columns). 

What kind of code you will find :
